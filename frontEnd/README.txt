Introduction:
------------
    Welcome to The Virtual Escape Room project from SUNY OSWEGO's CSC 380 course. In here
we attempt to create a project over the course of the semester and learning the process of
software development. In here we will connect two players to play the game where during 
phase 1 of the game we will have the players answer trivia questions that are dependent on
the administrator of the game discretion. When they answer all the questions within the
time limit they will move onto phase 2 of the game where each player will be placed into
different rooms where they will have to work together in order to complete the game. At the
end of the game after all the task have been completed we will show a result screen on how
the players did.

Question Instructions:

When filling our a new questions.json file the "id" is the position the question will
be when the questions in phase 1 start. Under "id" will be the "text" for the questions
within the questions phase that you would like to ask. Under that will be "options" where
there will be 4 entries of options and within each entry there will be a "text" label that
will take in answers for the question you have asked and "nexttext" which will either be the
same number as the current "id" number that you are on when the answer is the wrong choice,
or the next "id" number in the sequence of real numbers.
